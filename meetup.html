             Meetups are an excellent resource for those aspiring, to become a 
             Web Developer or to meet and hangout with like minded people. I was able
             to meet people of all levels of experience and years in the business.
             There were Developers from freelancing to ten year Google employees having a drink,
             talking tech. I was able to get contact information from everyone, and I will continue
             attending lots of meetups.
